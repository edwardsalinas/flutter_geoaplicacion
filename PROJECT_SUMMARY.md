# Flutter Geolocation App - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This Flutter application displays two geographic locations (home and work) on a map using Google Maps integration, with secure API key management using environment variables.

## Key Features Implemented
1. Google Maps display with two marked locations (home and work)
2. Secure API key handling using .env files
3. Proper Git configuration to exclude sensitive data
4. Environment variable loading with flutter_dotenv package

## Security Implementation
- Created two .env files:
  - `coordinates.env`: Contains geographic coordinates (included in Git)
  - `api_key.env`: Contains Google Maps API key (excluded from Git via .gitignore)
- Configured .gitignore to specifically exclude `api_key.env` while allowing `coordinates.env`
- Demonstrated that sensitive files are properly excluded from Git

## Files Created/Modified
- `pubspec.yaml`: Added google_maps_flutter and flutter_dotenv dependencies
- `lib/main.dart`: Implemented map display and environment variable loading
- `coordinates.env`: Contains latitude and longitude for home and work
- `api_key.env`: Contains API key (not included in Git)
- `.gitignore`: Configured to exclude api_key.env while including coordinates.env
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project
- Platform-specific files:
  - `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`: Configured for iOS Google Maps integration
  - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: Configured for Android Google Maps integration

## Verification of Security Measures
- Run `git ls-files | findstr key` returns no results, confirming that no files containing "key" are tracked by Git
- Run `git ls-files | findstr coordinates` shows that coordinates.env is properly tracked
- The .gitignore file specifically excludes api_key.env while allowing other files

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Obtain Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Update api_key.env with your actual API key
3. Update the platform-specific configuration files with your API key
4. Add proper permissions for location access if needed
5. Test the application on both Android and iOS platforms

## Project Security Compliance
✅ API key is stored in an untracked .env file
✅ .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files
✅ Coordinates file is safely committed to Git
✅ Documentation includes security best practices
✅ Platform-specific secure configuration implemented
